**Report on statistically differences of average male wages for the three race classes
Introduction**

This report explores the data set of roughly 25,000 records for males between the age of 18
and 70 who are full time workers and intend to answer the following two research questions
with the final linear regression model that incorporates all relevant variables, interactions and
functional forms of the covariates. The research questions are shown in the following
paragraph:
1. Do African American males have statistically different wages compared to Caucasian
males?
2. Do African American males have statistically different wages compared to all other
males?
First, plot the scatter plots of different explanatory variables versus the explained variable,
which is the logarithm of wage. The scatter plot of commuting distances versus log(wage)
seems reasonable, forming a rectangular shape centering on a horizontal line.
