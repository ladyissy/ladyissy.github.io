* Project summary: In this project, we created an OCR post-processing procedure to enhance Tesseract OCR output based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model.

* Error Detection: We implemented the 8 rules by Scott Kulp and April Kontostathis, On Retrieving Legal Files: <i>Shortening Documents and Weeding Out Garbage</i>.
<ol>
  <li>If a string is more than 20 characters in length, it is garbage. This rule was taken from rmgarbage, but shortened from 40 to 20 characters.</li>
  <li>If the number of punctuation characters in a string is greater than the number of alphanumeric characters, it is garbage. This rule was taken from rmgarbage.</li>
  <li>Ignoring the first and last characters in a string, if there are two or more different punctuation characters in the string, it is garbage. This rule was taken from rmgarbage.</li>
  <li>If there are three or more identical characters in a row in a string, it is garbage. This rule was taken from rmgarbage, but shortened from four or more characters to three.</li>
  <li>If the number of uppercase characters in a string is greater than the number of lowercase characters, and if the number of uppercase characters is less than the total number of characters in the string, it is garbage. This is a new rule we developed when we saw that OCR errors often created excessive numbers of uppercase characters, but normally, in English, there is usually no more than one uppercase character in a term. However, some- times real English words appeared in all uppercase characters, which is acceptable, so words that contain only uppercase characters are not considered garbage.</li>
  <li>If all the characters in a string are alphabetic, and if the number of consonants in the string is greater than 8 times the number of vowels in the string, or vice-versa, it is garbage. This rule was taken from rmgarbage, but the threshold was shortened from 10 to 8.</li>
  <li>If there are four or more consecutive vowels in the string or five or more consecutive consonants in the string, it is garbage. This is a new rule we developed when we noticed that real English words with these traits are rare, but this property appeared often in OCR errors.</li>
  <li>If the first and last characters in a string are both lowercase and any other character is uppercase, it is garbage. This rule was taken from rmgarbage.</li>
</ol>
